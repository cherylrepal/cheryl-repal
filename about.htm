	<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    		<p>Hi! Everyone! My name is Cheryl.<br>I am a graphic designer and a volunteer Sunday school teacher.<br>The third child of Deolita Moncada and Pablito Repal.<br>I was born on December 15, 1981 in Masbate.<br>My mom is a great sewer, and our dad is the best carpenter in town.<br><br>When I was child I dreamt of becoming a civil engineer because of the influence our Papa made in me.<br>I remember when he renovated our house, me and my older sister was his labourers.<br>Through that I've learned and loved carpentry.<br>Also because of that, the belief that 'I can do anything' was formed inside of me.<br>I always thought that if other can do it, I can able to do it too and  do it much better. <br>So I didn't ask for help from anyone regardless of the situation.<br><br>I was 9 years old when I first encountered God.<br>Our Sunday school teacher said God can be our friend.<br>And I want a friend like God, so I asked Him to be my bestfriend.<br><br>
October 31, 1999 - I've met an accident. My life drastically change and it make a 180 degree turn.<br>I am caught by surprise and I didn't welcome it with open arm.<br>Because I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me, I wore a mask to hide what's I truly feel inside.<br><br>11 months our mom died.<br>She left us, me and my other three younger siblings, to the care of our Ate (older sister) Joy.<br>At a young age, she took the responsibility of raising us, sending us to school, paying bills and taking good care of us.<br> My Ate (older sister) is the first person I admire.<br><br>2003, my Ate Joy approached me and asked me if I wanted to teach children in our Sunday school.<br>But I declined her, because I thought I'm not fit for job.<br>I am not patient with kids. I easily get irritated when someone is so loud.<br>But God called me. And after more than a decade I'm still teaching kids.<br>He fully equipped me to do the job.<br><br>Through the years, God has been graciously showered me with so much blessing<br>He sent a lot  of people to help me along the way.<br>He has shaped me to who I am today and is still shaping me.<br>Now I know that everything happened in my life is God's way of bringing me closer to Him.<br>And there's no other way that I can fully understand His plan for me if I had not gone through all of that.<br>The reason of my existence is God and God alone.
